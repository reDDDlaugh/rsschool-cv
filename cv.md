##About me

*For 10 years I’ve been working in mobile retail, another 10 years in the field of entertainment: Internet cafe, casino, cinema (at different times). At the moment, my goal is to gain experience in the front-end development and create a portfolio necessary to obtain the position of a junior software engineer. My strong and at the same time weak side is the desire to do everything independently, without someone else's help.*

##Education

*2017 - 2021 All-Russian State University of Cinematography named after S. A. Gerasimov (a.k.a. VGIK) - screenwriter
